# Phoenix project
## This project is already awesome and it's only getting better

List of project's files
- index.html - basic file
- scripts.js - contains js scripts
- file3.js and file4.txt - dummy files for testing

Last **2 items** can be *removed* (~deleted~)

I am not using any `npm` dependencies yet

Even smallest functions can return large blocks of info:

```html
    <div id="myTest">
        <script>
            myFunc()
        </script>
    </div>
```
A useful [link](https://google.com) to search information ;)
